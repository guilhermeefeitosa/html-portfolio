<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  My name is Guilherme Feitosa Agostinho. I'm 29 years old, born and raised in the city of Fortaleza, in Brazil. Avid gamer, passionate nerd, I have always been interested in geek stuff since I was a kid. My hobbies involve watching series, going to the movies and hanging out with my wife and friends. Travelling is what I do the most and my dream is to go all around the world.

  As a profesional, I'm a Senior QA with nearly 8 years of experience helping teams
  build reliable, user-friendly software. I enjoy working close to developers
  and product teams to make sure what we ship actually works for real people,
  not just in theory.
</p>

<p>
  My background includes strong experience in manual and automated testing, test
  case design, exploratory testing, and requirement analysis. I am used to
  validating complex user flows, identifying edge cases, and collaborating
  directly with developers, product managers, and designers to ensure
  high-quality releases.
